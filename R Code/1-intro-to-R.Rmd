## Development Environments
### Where to Write R Code

* For Windows machines, we have recently announced the general availability of [R Tools for Visual Studio, RTVS](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/rtvs-vs.aspx)
* RTVS supports connectivity to Azure and SQL Server
* The most popular integrated development environment for R is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* The RStudio IDE is entirely html/javascript based, so completely cross-platform
* RStudio Server provides a full IDE in your browser: perfect for cloud instances


## What is R?
### Why should I care?

* R is the successor to the S Language, originated at Bell Labs AT&T
* It is based on the Scheme interpreter
* Originally designed by two University of Auckland Professors for their introductory statistics course

![Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka](http://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b016766fdae38970b-800wi)

## R's Philosophy
### What R Thou?

R follows the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well (modularity)
* Write programs that work together (cohesiveness)
* R is extensible with more than 10,000 packages available at CRAN (http://crantastic.org/packages)


## The aRt of Being Lazy
### Lazy Evaluation in R

![](http://i.imgur.com/5GbW690.gif)


* R, like it's inspiration, Scheme, is a _functional_ programming language
* R evaluates lazily, delaying evaluation until necessary, which can make it very flexible
* R is a highly interpreted dynamically typed language, allowing you to mutate variables and analyze datasets quickly, but is significantly slower than low-level, statically typed languages like C or Java
* R has a high memory footprint, and can easily lead to crashes if you aren't careful

## R's Programming Paradigm
### Keys to R

<span class="fragment">Everything that exist in R is an *object*</span>
<br>
<span class="fragment">Everything that happens in R is a *function call*</span>
<br>
<span class="fragment">R was born to *interface*</span>
<br>

<span class="fragment">_—John Chambers_</span>

## Strengths of R
### Where R Succeeds

* Expressive
* Open source
* Extendable -- nearly 10,000 packages with functions to use, and that list continues to grow
* Focused on statistics and machine learning -- cutting-edge algorithms and powerful data manipulation packages
* Advanced data structures and graphical capabilities
* Large user community, both within academia and industry
* It is designed by statisticians

## Weaknesses of R
### Where R Falls Short

* It is designed by statisticians
* Inefficient at element-by-element computations
* May make large demands on system resources, namely memory
* Data capacity limited by memory
* Single-threaded

## Some Essential Open Source Packages

* There are over 10,000 R packages to choose from, what do I start with?
* Data Management: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `data.table`
* Visualization: `ggplot2`, `ggvis`, `htmlwidgets`, `shiny`
* Data Importing: `haven`, `RODBC`, `readr`, `foreign`
* Other favorites: `magrittr`, `rmarkdown`, `caret`

## Quick Tour of Things You Need to Know
### Data Structures

> "Bad programmers worry about the code.
> Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."
> - Linus Torvalds

* R's data structures can be described by their dimensionality, and their type.


|    | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous |
|----|---------------|---------------|
| 1d | Atomic vector | List          |
| 2d | Matrix        | Data frame    |
| nd | Array         |               |

## Quick Tour of Things You Need to Know

### Data Types

* Atomic vectors come in one of four types
* `logical` (boolean). Values: `TRUE` | `FALSE`
* `integer`
* `double` (often called numeric)
* `character`
* Rare types:
* `complex`
* `raw`

## Manipulating Data Structures

### Subsetting Operators

* To create a vector, use `c`: `c(1, 4, 1, 3)`
* To create a list, use `list`: `list(1, 'hi', data.frame(1:10, letters[1:10]))`
* To subset a vector or list, use the `[ ]`
  - inside the brackets:
    + positive integer vectors for indices you want
    + negative integer vectors for indices you want to drop
    + logical vectors for indices you want to keep/drop (TRUE/FALSE)
    + character vectors for named vectors corresponding to which named elements you want to keep
    + subsetting a list with a single square bracket always returns a list
+ To subset a list and get back just that element, use `[[ ]]`

### Object Representation

+ To find the type of an object, use `class` (_higher level representation_)
+ To find how the object is stored in memory, use `typeof` (_lower level representation_)
+ Good time to do Lab 0!

# Data Manipulation with the `dplyr` Package

## Overview

Rather than describing the nitty gritty details of writing R code, I'd like you to get started at immediately writing R code.

As most of you are data scientists/data enthusiasts, I will showcase one of the most useful data manipulation packages in R, `dplyr`.
At the end of this session, you will have learned:

* How to manipulate data quickly with `dplyr` using a very intuitive _"grammar"_
* How to use `dplyr` to perform common exploratory analysis data manipulation procedures
* How to apply your own custom functions to group manipulations `dplyr` with `mutate()`, `summarise()` and `do()`
* Connect to remote databases to work with larger than memory datasets

## Why use dplyr?
### The Grammar of Data Manipulation

* `dplyr` is currently the [most downloaded package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.5.0?) from CRAN
* `dplyr` makes data manipulation easier by providing a few functions for the most common tasks and procedures
* `dplyr` achieves remarkable speed-up gains by using a C++ backend
* `dplyr` has multiple backends for working with data stored in various sources: SQLite, MySQL, bigquery, SQL Server, and many more
* `dplyr` was inspired to give data manipulation a simple, cohesive grammar (similar philosophy to `ggplot` - grammar of graphics)
* `dplyr` has inspired many new packages, which now adopt it's easy to understand syntax.
* The recent packages `dplyrXdf` and `SparkR/sparklyr` brings much of the same functionality of `dplyr` to `XDF`s data and Spark `DataFrames`


## Tidy Data and Happier Coding
### Premature Optimization

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png)

+ For a dats scientist, the most important parameter to optimize in a data science development cycle is YOUR time
+ It is therefore important to be able to write efficient code, quickly
+ Goals: writing fast code that is: portable, platform invariant, easy to understand, and easy to debug
    - __Be serious about CReUse__!

## Manipulation verbs

`filter`

:    select rows based on matching criteria

`slice`

:    select rows by number

`select`

:    select columns by column names

`arrange`

:    reorder rows by column values

`mutate`

:    add new variables based on transformations of existing variables

`transmute`

:    transform and drop other variables



## Aggregation verbs

`group_by`

:    identify grouping variables for calculating groupwise summary statistics


`count`

:    count the number of records per group


`summarise` | `summarize`

:    calculate one or more summary functions per group, returning one row of results per group (or one for the entire dataset)

## NYC Taxi Data
### Data for Class

* The data we will be examining in this module is dervided from the [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/home/home.shtml)
* Data contains taxi trips in NYC, and includes spatial features (pickup and dropoff neighborhoods), temporal features, and monetary features (fare and tip amounts)
* The dataset for this module is saved as an _rds_ file in a public facing Azure storage blob
* An _rds_ file is a compressed, serialized R object
* Save an object to _rds_ by using the `saveRDS` function; read an _rds_ object with the `readRDS` object

## Viewing Data
### tibble

* `dplyr` includes a wrapper called `tbl_df` that adds an additional class attribute onto `data.frames` that provides some better data manipulation aesthetics (there's now a dedicated package [`tibble`](www.github.com/hadley/tibble) for this wrapper and it's class)
* Most noticeable differential between `tbl_df` and `data.frame`s is the console output: `tbl_df`s will only print what the current R console window can display
* Can change the default setting for number of displayed columns by changing the options parameter: `options(dplyr.width = Inf)`




```{r}
#----------------------
#Code cell 1
#----------------------

.libPaths(c(.libPaths(),'/anaconda/lib/R/library/'))
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = 'center')
```


```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 2
#----------------------

# Source in All Necessary Libraries
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(broom)
library(dplyrXdf)
library(ggplot2)

# Load Data
taxi_url <- "http://alizaidi.blob.core.windows.net/training/taxi_df.rds"
taxi_df  <- readRDS(gzcon(url(taxi_url)))
(taxi_df <- tbl_df(taxi_df))
```


# Filtering and Reordering Data

## Subsetting Data

* `dplyr` makes subsetting by rows very easy
* The `filter` verb takes conditions for filtering rows based on conditions
* **every** `dplyr` function uses a data.frame/tbl as it's first argument
* Additional conditions are passed as new arguments (no need to make an insanely complicated expression, split em up!)

## Filter





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 3
#----------------------

filter(taxi_df,
       dropoff_dow %in% c("Fri", "Sat", "Sun"),
       tip_amount > 1)
```


## Exercise

Your turn:

* How many observations started in Harlem?
  - pick both sides of Harlem, including east harlem
* How many observations that started in Harlem ended in the Financial District?

## Solution





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 4
#----------------------

table(taxi_df$pickup_nhood)
harlem_pickups <- filter(taxi_df, str_detect(pickup_nhood, "Harlem"))
harlem_pickups
```



```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 5
#----------------------

nrow(filter(harlem_pickups, dropoff_nhood=="Financial District"))
```


## Select a set of columns

* You can use the `select()` verb to specify which columns of a dataset you want
* This is similar to the `keep` option in SAS's data step.
* Use a colon `:` to select all the columns between two variables (inclusive)
* Use `contains` to take any columns containing a certain word/phrase/character

## Select Example





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 6
#----------------------

select(taxi_df, pickup_nhood, dropoff_nhood,
       fare_amount, dropoff_hour, trip_distance)
```


## Select: Other Options

starts_with(x, ignore.case = FALSE)

:    name starts with `x`

ends_with(x, ignore.case = FALSE)

:    name ends with `x`

matches(x, ignore.case = FALSE)

:    selects all variables whose name matches the regular expression `x`

num_range("V", 1:5, width = 1)

:    selects all variables (numerically) from `V1` to `V5`.

* You can also use a `-` to drop variables.

## Reordering Data

* You can reorder your dataset based on conditions using the `arrange()` verb
* Use the `desc` function to sort in descending order rather than ascending order (default)

## Arrange





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 7
#----------------------

select(arrange(taxi_df, desc(fare_amount), pickup_nhood),
       fare_amount, pickup_nhood)

head(select(arrange(taxi_df, desc(fare_amount), pickup_nhood),
       fare_amount, pickup_nhood), 10)
```





## Exercise
Use `arrange()` to  sort on the basis of `tip_amount`, `dropoff_nhood`, and `pickup_dow`, with descending order for tip amount

## Summary

filter

:    Extract subsets of rows. See also `slice()`

select

:    Extract subsets of columns. See also `rename()`

arrange

:    Sort your data

# Data Aggregations and Transformations

## Transformations

* The `mutate()` verb can be used to make new columns





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 8
#----------------------

taxi_df <- mutate(taxi_df, tip_pct = tip_amount/fare_amount)
select(taxi_df, tip_pct, fare_amount, tip_amount)
#transmute(taxi_df, tip_pct = tip_amount/fare_amount)
```


## Summarise Data by Groups

* The `group_by` verb creates a grouping by a categorical variable
* Functions can be placed inside `summarise` to create summary functions





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 9 
#----------------------

grouped_taxi <- group_by(taxi_df, dropoff_nhood)
class(grouped_taxi)
grouped_taxi
```


```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 10
#----------------------

summarize(group_by(taxi_df, dropoff_nhood),
          Num = n(), ave_tip_pct = mean(tip_pct))
```


## Group By Neighborhoods Example





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 11
#----------------------

summarise(group_by(taxi_df, pickup_nhood, dropoff_nhood),
          Num = n(), ave_tip_pct = mean(tip_pct))
```


## Chaining/Piping

* A `dplyr` installation includes the `magrittr` package as a dependency
* The `magrittr` package includes a pipe operator that allows you to pass the current dataset to another function
* This makes interpreting a nested sequence of operations much easier to understand

## Standard Code

* Code is executed inside-out.
* Let's arrange the above average tips in descending order, and only look at the locations that had at least 10 dropoffs and pickups.





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 12
#----------------------

filter(arrange(summarise(group_by(taxi_df, pickup_nhood, dropoff_nhood), Num = n(), ave_tip_pct = mean(tip_pct)), desc(ave_tip_pct)), Num >= 10)
```

![damn](http://www.ohmagif.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lemme-go-out-for-a-walk-oh-no-shit.gif)

## Reformatted





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 13
#----------------------

filter(
  arrange(
    summarise(
      group_by(taxi_df,
               pickup_nhood, dropoff_nhood),
      Num = n(),
      ave_tip_pct = mean(tip_pct)),
    desc(ave_tip_pct)),
  Num >= 10)
```


## Magrittr

![](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr/raw/master/inst/logo.png)

* Inspired by unix `|`, and F# forward pipe `|>`, `magrittr` introduces the funny character (`%>%`, the _then_ operator)
* `%>%` pipes the object on the left hand side to the first argument of the function on the right hand side
* Every function in `dplyr` has a slot for `data.frame/tbl` as it's first argument, so this works beautifully!

## Put that Function in Your Pipe and...





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 15
#----------------------

taxi_df %>%
  group_by(pickup_nhood, dropoff_nhood) %>%
  summarize(Num = n(),
            ave_tip_pct = mean(tip_pct)) %>%
  arrange(desc(ave_tip_pct)) %>%
  filter(Num >= 10)
```


---

![hellyeah](http://i.giphy.com/lF1XZv45kIwMw.gif)

## Pipe + group_by()

* The pipe operator is very helpful for group by summaries
* Let's calculate average tip amount, and average trip distance, controlling for dropoff day of the week and dropoff location
* First filter with the vector `manhattan_hoods`

---





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 16
#----------------------

mht_url <- "http://alizaidi.blob.core.windows.net/training/manhattan.rds"
manhattan_hoods <- readRDS(gzcon(url(mht_url)))
taxi_df %>%
  filter(pickup_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods,
         dropoff_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_nhood, pickup_nhood) %>%
  summarize(ave_tip = mean(tip_pct),
            ave_dist = mean(trip_distance)) %>%
  filter(ave_dist > 3, ave_tip > 0.05)
```


## Pipe and Plot

Piping is not limited to dplyr functions, can be used everywhere!





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 17
#----------------------

taxi_df %>%
  filter(pickup_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods,
         dropoff_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_nhood, pickup_nhood) %>%
  summarize(ave_tip = mean(tip_pct),
            ave_dist = mean(trip_distance)) %>%
  filter(ave_dist > 3, ave_tip > 0.05) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pickup_nhood, y = dropoff_nhood)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = ave_tip), colour = "white") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          legend.position = 'bottom') +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue")

```



## Piping to other arguments

* Although `dplyr` takes great care to make it particularly amenable to piping, other functions may not reserve the first argument to the object you are passing into it.
* You can use the special `.` placeholder to specify where the object should enter





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 18
#----------------------

taxi_df %>%
  filter(pickup_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods,
         dropoff_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_nhood, pickup_nhood) %>%
  summarize(ave_tip = mean(tip_pct),
            ave_dist = mean(trip_distance)) %>%
  lm(ave_tip ~ ave_dist, data = .) -> taxi_model
summary(taxi_model)
```


## Exercise

Your turn:

* Use the pipe operator to group by day of week and dropoff neighborhood
* Filter to Manhattan neighborhoods
* Make tile plot with average fare amount in dollars as the fill

# Functional Programming

## Creating Functional Pipelines
### Too Many Pipes?

![whoaaaaaaaaahhhhh](http://www.ohmagif.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/the-scariest-electrical-repair-ever.gif)

---

### Reusable code

* The examples above create a rather messy pipeline operation
* Can be very hard to debug
* The operation is pretty readable, but lacks reusability
* Since R is a functional language, we benefit by splitting these operations into functions and calling them separately
* This allows resuability; don't write the same code twice!

## Functional Pipelines
### Summarization

* Let's create a function that takes an argument for the data, and applies the summarization by neighborhood to calculate average tip and trip distance

---





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 19
#----------------------

taxi_hood_sum <- function(taxi_data = taxi_df) {

  mht_url <- "http://alizaidi.blob.core.windows.net/training/manhattan.rds"

  manhattan_hoods <- readRDS(gzcon(url(mht_url)))
  taxi_data %>%
    filter(pickup_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods,
           dropoff_nhood %in% manhattan_hoods) %>%
    group_by(dropoff_nhood, pickup_nhood) %>%
    summarize(ave_tip = mean(tip_pct),
              ave_dist = mean(trip_distance)) %>%
    filter(ave_dist > 3, ave_tip > 0.05) -> sum_df

  return(sum_df)

}

```


## Functional Pipelines

### Plotting Function

* We can create a second function for the plot





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 20
#----------------------

tile_plot_hood <- function(df = taxi_hood_sum()) {


  ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pickup_nhood, y = dropoff_nhood)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = ave_tip), colour = "white") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
          legend.position = 'bottom') +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") -> gplot

  return(gplot)
}

```


## Calling Our Pipeline

* Now we can create our plot by simply calling our two functions





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 21
#----------------------

taxi_hood_sum(taxi_df) %>% tile_plot_hood 
```


Let's make that baby interactive.

## Creating Complex Pipelines with do

* The `summarize` function is fun, can summarize many numeric/scalar quantities
* But what if you want multiple values/rows back, not just a scalar summary?
* Meet the `do` verb -- arbitrary `tbl` operations

---





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 22
#----------------------

taxi_df %>% group_by(dropoff_dow) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dropoff_nhood), !is.na(pickup_nhood)) %>%
  arrange(desc(tip_pct)) %>%
  do(slice(., 1:2)) %>%
  select(dropoff_dow, tip_amount, tip_pct,
         fare_amount, dropoff_nhood, pickup_nhood)
```


## Estimating Multiple Models with do

* A common use of `do` is to calculate many different models by a grouping variable





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 23
#----------------------

dow_lms <- taxi_df %>% sample_n(10^4) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_dow) %>%
  do(lm_tip = lm(tip_pct ~ pickup_nhood + passenger_count + pickup_hour,
     data = .))
```


---





```{r}
#dow_lms
```



Where are our results?

## Cleaning Output





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 24
#----------------------

summary(dow_lms$lm_tip[[1]])
dow_lms %>% tidy(lm_tip)
```



* By design, every function in `dplyr` returns a `data.frame`
* In the example above, we get back a spooky `data.frame` with a column of `S3` `lm` objects
* You can still modify each element as you would normally, or pass it to a `mutate` function to extract intercept or statistics
* But there's also a very handy `broom` package for cleaning up such objects into `data.frames`

## Brooming Up the Mess

### Model Metrics




```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 25
#----------------------

taxi_df %>% sample_n(10^5) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_dow) %>%
  do(glance(lm(tip_pct ~ pickup_nhood + passenger_count + pickup_hour,
     data = .)))

```


### Model Coefficients

The most commonly used function in the `broom` package is the `tidy` function. This will expand our data.frame and give us the model coefficients





```{r}
#----------------------
# Code cell 26
#----------------------

taxi_df %>% sample_n(10^5) %>%
  group_by(dropoff_dow) %>%
  do(tidy(lm(tip_pct ~ pickup_nhood + passenger_count + pickup_hour,
     data = .)))
```



## Summary

mutate

:    Create transformations

summarise

:    Aggregate

group_by

:    Group your dataset by levels

do

:    Evaluate complex operations on a tbl

Chaining with the `%>%` operator can result in more readable code.

## What We Didn't Cover

* There are many additional topics that fit well into the `dplyr` and functional programming landscape
* There are too many to cover in one session. Fortunately, most are well documented. The most notable omissions:
  1. Connecting to remote databases, see `vignette('databases', package = 'dplyr')`
  2. Merging and Joins, see `vignette('two-table', package = 'dplyr')`
  3. Programming with `dplyr`,`vignette('nse', package = 'dplyr')`
  4. `summarize_each` and `mutate_each`
